# Electricity_Investments
df1 shows the company which strategies are available to invest in when the company wants to deploy an
energy asset this can be the deployment of an energy storage unit, upgrade of a new transmission line,
etc. on the other hand, df2 groups the investment strategies that are mutually exclusive (in other for a
two investment strategies to mutually exclusive there has to be a union of at least one investment asset
in their investment strategies, which makes it impossible to invest in both because the 3-letter code
investment asset represents an investment in the same energy asset at a specific location and same time).
